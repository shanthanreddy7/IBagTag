Sample Functional Code for Flashing IBAGTAG (Nordic Semiconductor) via BLE
This repository contains a functional code logic to flash a Nordic Semiconductor device with different lights (currently Red and Green) by establishing a connection using BLE protocols.

Overview
This code serves as a proof of concept (POC) for a system designed to locate bags on a conveyor belt in airports efficiently. By utilizing flashlights, this solution reduces the time required to identify specific luggage.

Features
Establishes a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) connection to the Nordic Semiconductor device.
Flashes the device's lights in two colors:
Red
Green
Provides a simple and scalable approach to enhance luggage identification in high-traffic areas like airports.
Tech Stack
Hardware: Nordic Semiconductor-based embedded system.
Firmware Programming Language: C++
Mobile Application:
Language: C#
Framework: Xamarin
Use Case
This POC is tailored for airports, where locating bags on conveyor belts can be time-consuming. By leveraging BLE-enabled devices and visual signals (flashing lights), travelers or staff can quickly identify the desired luggage, improving operational efficiency and user experience.

Future Enhancements
Adding support for more light colors and patterns.
Expanding use cases to other industries requiring visual identification systems.
Enhancing mobile app features for real-time device management and user interaction.
